    <p id="description">
      Since 1.6.0 version, Eclipse EEF brings a brand new language and runtime in order to build your user interface. The language is not coupled with the
      meta-model of the user anymore with a similar approach as Eclipse Sirius based on queries, as such it provides highly dynamic mechanisms to build an user interface. The new
      runtime is based on the same philosophy as Eclipse Sirius with a declarative approach interpreted on the fly.
